# Introduction 
In golf, TrackMan provides data on the club and ball. We are currently investigating how we also can start to deliver data on body movement.
Especially the kinematic sequence of the golf swing is of interest, which is the rotational velocities of the pelvis (hip), thorax (upper body), and arms. For more details see
*`basic-biomechanics-principles-for-golf-dr-phil-cheetham-biomechanics.pdf`*.

The attached data is from a motion capture session with an optical marker-based system called Qualisys. The files provided contain the same information and you're free to use the one that you're most familiar with. We have provided a small starting script `example.py`, with some starting code for loading and visualizing the data in the JSON file.



# Task
The following questions have multiple solutions and can be solved with different assumptions. You shouldn't spend more than a few hours on these tasks. We don't expect you to come up with a perfect solution for the questions but consider the following questions.

1.	Compute and plot the kinematic sequence of the golf swing
    - It is fair to consider different assumptions here.
    - You don't have to include the club motion in the sequence.
2.	Consider how this can be done for noisy motion data.
